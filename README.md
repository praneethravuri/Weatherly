A Vue.js app provides instant weather details of a location based on its latitude and longitude. The app utilizes the Google Maps API and the Open Weather API to perform reverse geocoding on the latitude and longitude coordinates, resulting in the generation of an address. This address is then used as input for the Open Weather API to retrieve and display weather information."
